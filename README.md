# Udemy Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science Jupyter notebooks

Thеsе notebooks contain the code used to follow the Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science course offered by Udemy (as of 2017-08-10).

Additional data files would be needed to make them work. These were downloaded [from the SuperDataScience website](https://www.superdatascience.com/machine-learning/), but were too large to be added to the repository.
